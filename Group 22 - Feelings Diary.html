		Mood.io is an app designed to let users keep a diary on their Android mobile device. The app uses Firebase to authenticate users and store information about the user's
		diary entries. Once the user is logged in, Mood.io provides the user with four main features: entry creation, entry viewing by date, entry viewing by searching, and statistics about the
		user. The app also reminds the user to make an entry every day if they have not made an entry in a while. This notification system can be made less frequent or turned off through
		a settings menu. More detailed information about these features is discussed below. <br/> <br/>

		<b>Logging In</b><br/>
		This is the first screen the user will see. The user can simply enter their email and password to log into the app. If the user does not have an account yet, they can click a button
		to go to the sign up page. Here, a user will enter their email, a password, and retype their password. Pressing the "Sign Up" button will register the user and return to the log in 
		screen. Of course, if their email or password is malformed or the two passwords don't match, the user will not be registered and an error will be shown to the user. If the user 
		forgets their password, they can always reset it. From the log in page, users can go to the reset password page where they can enter their email. Firebase will send them an 
		email with instructions to reset their password, as long as the email they entered is registered with Mood.io. Logging in and signing up requires FirebaseAuth. The app will start 
		an AsyncTask to do this work so the app doesn't hang while this potentially lengthy operation occurs. While the AsyncTask is running, the UI is hidden and a loading spinner appears. 
		Once the AsyncTask finishes, the main menu screen opens. <br/> <br/>

		<b>Main Menu</b><br/>
		The main menu is very straightforward. It contains five buttons: "New Entry", "Stats", "Calendar", "Search Entries", and "Sign Out". The first four buttons will open up their respective
		feature. Pressing the "Sign Out" button will log the user out and return to the log in screen.
